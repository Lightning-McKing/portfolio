        <p class="am">CNN Model</p>
        <p class="tsddet">AI model where it predicts traffic signs,coded in python using Convolutional
          neural networks and Computer vision,42 different traffic signs are pre-trained in which machine has
          its training part.Dataset is downloaded from kaggle.There are several traffic signs in which each
          of them is segregated into classes,and the input is converted into continous frame of images and predicted
          among one of those 42 classes.</p>
        <a class="btn btn-lg" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Lightning-McKing/traffic-sign-detection">Access resource</a>
        <p class="tsddet">The reason behind developing this is bassically i have an interest in automobile so i ended making an AI model
          which is related to cars.The above button can redirect you to Github repository where you can access the code and dataset.</p>

        <p class="am">CNN Model</p>
        <p class="cmddet">I have an curiosity in the field of Artificial Intelligence which makes me to develop another model,basically this one
          classifies whether a person wears a mask or not.This project was done during COVID pandemic so this was the motive behind it.As usual
          the dataset is retrieved from kaggle and the model has 2 classes in its training part,one class is that a person wears mask,
          other is with a person who doesn't wear mask.</p>
        <a class="btn btn-lg" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Lightning-McKing/corona-mask-detection">Access resource</a>
        <p class="cmddet">In essence,the model predicts whether the given input belongs to class 1 or 2(wears mask or dont wear mask).

        <p class="hdcdet">This is a fundamental concept(Regular Neural Network) of AI models,again the dataset is extracted from kaggle.So this model
          has 2 labels(the probability of a person where he/she can have heart attack and where he/she don't have).The dataset has the details of
          medical paramaters of a individual such as Blood pressure,Hemoglobin,Body temperature,Blood oxygen saturation in which it gets trained upon it
          and the model predicts as mentioned above.</p>

        <p class="hdcdet">But still the accuracy of this model can be improved by altering the architecture.
